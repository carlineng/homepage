I am an American, the second child of two Chinese immigrants who came to this country
seeking the promise of the American Dream. I have always identified as
American; and only very rarely, in very specific circumstances, have I felt connected
with my Chinese ancestry. Without thousands of years of history and culture to guide it,
the question of "What does it mean to be American?" is nebulous and difficult to answer.
I recently came to the realization that my whole life, I have gravitated towards
works of art and literature that offer perspective on this question.

- Many people strongly identify with their heritage. Perhaps my obsession with American
  identity stems from my lack of connection to my heritage?

- The American Dream, what does it mean for different people?
	- Parents, grandparents, a better life, opportunity, children
	- Me?
- Gravitate towards "American" works of art. Literature, film, television, music.
	- Grapes of Wrath, Rabbit, Run, As I Lay Dying
	- The Graduate
	- The Wire
- Folk music
