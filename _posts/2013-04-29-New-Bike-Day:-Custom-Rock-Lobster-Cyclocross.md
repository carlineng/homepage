Ladies and gentlemen, I proudly present to you my newest bicycle: a custom, tig-welded, steel [Rock Lobster](http://www.rocklobstercycles.com/). I ordered this back on November in the midst of CX season. After three races, I came down with a serious case of the cyclocross bug, and I’ve always been a huge fan of Paul Sadoff’s no-nonsense, pragmatic, rider-comes-first philosophy towards bikes and frame-building, so it made perfect sense for me to order a frame from him. The guy works hard, is great at what he does, and genuinely loves the sport of cycling and the community around it.

I've named the bike Edna, which comes from one of my favorite TV shows, Futurama. Zoidberg is the show's resident crustacean and medical doctor, and Edna is the object of his unrequited desire. As a bonus, the name keeps alive my previous tradition of christening my bikes with outdated ladies' names (my Cross Check is named Dottie).

I believe the front triangle is True Temper OX Platinum tubing, with Dedacciai chainstays and seatstays. I’m using a mostly Shimano drivetrain. The crankset is a  SRAM Force 110 BCD crankset on which I’ve switched the chainrings to a traditional CX compact (46/36). Combining with an 11-28 10sp cassette in the rear gives me a wide enough range to ride almost everything I’ve encountered in the Bay Area thus far. Paul Minimoto brakes provide some serious stopping power for either steep fire road descents or coming around hot corners in a CX race. The rest of the bike is standard fare: 3T stem and seatpost, Specialized Romin Ti-railed saddle, Ritchey Logic II handlebars, and Lizardskins bartape.

This isn’t a pure race bike, and I intend on using it for almost all of my recreational rides that don’t require me to carry a load (e.g., touring or extra long brevets), thus versatility is key. The bike has fender eyelets in case I ever move to a region with a climate less amenable to cycling. As a direct result of this, Paul also slightly increased the tire clearance to allow me to have fenders and still run decently wide tires. I plan on having two wheelsets for this bike, both with Shimano hubs laced to Velocity A23 rims. During CX season, the training set (with 32H Ultegra 6500 hubs) will be run with slicks and serve as my primary wheels, while my nicer set (28H Dura Ace 7900 hubs) will have knobbies mounted, and function as race wheels. When CX season is over, I’ll swap the knobbies and slicks and run my nicer wheels on longer recreational road rides, while using the knobbies for whatever weird mixed terrain adventures await.

I haven’t done a serious ride on this bike yet, but the two short 20 mile rides I’ve done so far have been an absolute blast. The moment I sat on the saddle and set my hands on the bars, my first thought was “Oh yeah. This bike was definitely made for me.” I’m looking forward to many years of quality time in the saddle of this top-notch frame!
