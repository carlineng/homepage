Each year, the Flèche marks the unofficial start of randonneuring season for many
cyclists, as it's the first ride of the year where sleep deprivation is a real factor.
The Flèche is a team ride designed to last 24 hours and cover at least 360 km of ground.
Each registered team submits a route to the club coordinator for approval. Teams start
from many different points around the Bay Area and beyond, but all finish at Crepes on Cole
at roughly the same time to trade tales from their respective rides. This year, I rode
with Team Boyz on the Hoods, which, in addition to myself, consisted of Brian (team captain),
Irving, and Ian -- a ruggedly handsome group whom you may recognize from the Swoop Here Tour
of 2013.

Our route this year started in Cazadero, where Ian's parents graciously offered to host us
the night before the start. Starting already so far north would allow us to ride farther from
San Francisco than I'd ever been on a bicycle. The route started down River Road towards the coast --
a path I'm familiar with from the Russian River 300km brevet. Both times I've ridden the brevet, I 
experienced a brutal headwind starting about four miles inland from the coast.
This time around, the winds were still. I took this as a sign of good things to come.

We turned north at the intersection of River Rd and Hwy 1. Once again, I was
prepared to fight a brutal headwind as we traveled north for the next 40 miles.
We were surprised instead to find a tailwind pushing us the entire way.
Patchwork fog covered the coast, and views of the cliffs came and went in a series of 
short steep climbs followed by fast, cambered descents.
The roads all looked and felt freshly paved despite road signs every 3 miles warning us of rough
pavement. We stopped at Fort Ross for a quick bout of
tourism, where a grandfatherly reenactor bored us with his testudinate speech patterns and
historical tales of questionable truth.

We broke for lunch at Antonio's Tacos in Gualala. Fifty miles in the bag, and I was feeling better
than ever -- hungry, but still fresh, and buzzing in anticipation of the next 30 miles on Fish Rock Rd.
I split an order of carne asada fries and a taco plate with Brian, but made sure not to overstuff myself
lest I suffer for it on the upcoming miles.

On our "training" ride the previous week through Butano Fire Road, Ian pointed out to me the
difficulty of capturing steepness in photographs. Grades of 15%+ look positively mild,
though the anguished faces of the photographed riders often tell a different story. The net effect
is just the opposite of what is often intended. Rather than looking like hard men on a ride of
sanity-melting difficulty, we often look like unwitting, unprepared newbies struggling up tiny bumps.

Though the picture above may look like nothing special, the 30 miles of Fish Rock Rd were without
a doubt some of the most challenging 30 miles I've ridden to date. Immediately after turning
off the Pacific Coast onto Fish Rock, the road pitched up at nearly 18% on a well-paved, but single
lane road, going straight up into the mountains without any switchbacks to even out the grade.
After the first climb, a quick descent lost most of the elevation of the previous mile, and the
pavement gave way to fire road for the next 15 miles -- mostly hard-packed dirt with a smattering of
loose gravel overtop. The dirt portion, while not particularly technical, was brutally steep. There
were three distinct climbs, the first one the longest and most difficult. The road alternated 
frequently between tree cover and open air, and we were consistently treated to breathtaking views
of a seemingly endless treeline and ominous cloud formations threatening
to rain on us from above.

Fish Rock Road ends with a long, very technical 4 mile paved descent,
a small paved climb, and a final short but steep descent ending at Highway 128.
We had spent the over four hours on Fish Rock, and were all relieved that
the most difficult portion of the ride was behind us.
Next, we headed eastbound on 128, and turned yet further north on Mountain House
for a short, yet beautiful detour through a series of hills spotted with oak trees
draped in Spanish moss.
Mountain House dead ends at the 101, and we stopped for a much-needed dinner
at Burger My Way in Hopland.

As the sun dipped down closer to the horizon, it cast a wild palette of colors on
the cloud formations above. We stopped to take some photographs, but our awe was
slightly dampered by the knowledge that those clouds almost certainly meant rain.

![Crazy clouds](/images/fish_rock_fleche/03_sunset_clouds.jpg)

Once the last of the day's sunlight faded, a light drizzle set in. Initially, we all
groaned at the thought of riding through the night in the rain, but before too long
we grew accustomed -- grateful even -- to the moisture which retained much of the
heat from the day and spared us from the often brutal cold of North Bay nights.

It goes without saying that night riding presents a host of challenges unfamiliar
to the uninitiated. In a team environment, the character of the ride changes drastically.
Everyone is tired, both physically and mentally, and the ride atmosphere often flips
back and forth between silent focus and introspection and a superfluous, almost
desperate chatter between exhausted teammates trying to keep each other awake.
Without scenery or landmarks to aid my memory in keeping an accurate record of events,
the night riding portion flew by in a blur of pavement and mild rain.

![Flat fixing](/images/fish_rock_fleche/04_flat_fixing.jpg)

Some memorable nighttime events include fixing Brian's flat tire (shown above), looking
back and realizing we had dropped Irving (turns out he also had a flat, but no one had
realized), and singing along to the Weezer tunes (The Blue Album) playing from Irving's
phone.

At several points during the night, the rain picked up from a mere drizzle
to something more substantial that required an actual rain jacket. Unfortunately,
real waterproof materials do not breath at all, and when the terrain is hilly (as
was ours), a rain jacket can get suffocatingly hot. I had previously assumed it was 
a choice between soaking in cold rainwater or soaking in clammy sweat beneath a rain
shell, but Ian offered up a remarkable piece of randonneuring wisdom. Hands are
excellent heat ventilators, and going with rain jacket but sans gloves ensures
that you never get too hot in a rain jacket, while your core stays warm and dry.

![Petaluma Dennys](/images/fish_rock_fleche/04_petaluma_dennys.jpg)

Our next stop was Petaluma Denny's. We arrived at roughly 1 AM, and I think the only
time I've ever been happier to see a Denny's was, in fact, on last year's Flèche.
Aside from one other group of randonneurs who had also chosen this spot as a control,
the rest of the late night Denny's crowd in Petaluma was rather unsavory. Loud-mouthed
drunk people behind us spouted ignorant anti-gay marriage nonsense. We sighed into
our mugs of weak coffee and shoveled down platefuls of greasy hashbrowns, waffles,
and pancakes.

Our last control before the finish was the Tiburon Denny's. Not because we love
Denny's so much (we don't), but because what else in Marin is open at 4 AM?
What other establishment will tolerate hordes of stinking, exhausted, grumpy
cyclists at ungodly hours? The ride from Petaluma to Tiburon was all familiar
territory for me, yet every mile felt vastly different as I'd never ridden
through the Nicasio area in the dead of night. It was mostly peaceful, but at
times creepy -- we passed by what looked like a lone person with a flashlight
wandering through the fields on our left on Sir Francis Drake. A little further
down the road, we saw a red strobe light flashing through the window of a
standalone home (or storefront?), with no indication of why or what was happening.

Up until around 5 AM, I had held up pretty well against mental fatigue, but
misery set in on the segment through Fairfax to the Tiburon Denny's. I also felt
with some urgency the digestive effects of three large meals over the course of
last 22 hours. We rolled up to the god-forsaken pancake joint in Tiburon and my
first stop was the toilet. I sat down at our table completely exhausted, both
physically and mentally, yet with absolutely zero appetite. Given that we were so
close to the end, we kept our stay short.

I hadn't eaten anything at the stop,
and bonked as we made our way through Tiburon back to the city. Oddly enough,
I started craving Shot Bloks -- little 10g cubes of pure sugar and artificial
flavor, manufactured by Clif Bar and marketed towards athletes. I very rarely
eat "performance" foods on rides, preferring instead the comfort of normal person
comestibles (pastries, candy, etc.), and I have never before felt a craving
for these objects of my frequent derision. Yet here I was, bonking hard, and
all I could think of were Shot Bloks. I mentioned this to Ian and he, as if he
had been saving them for just this occasion, miraculously pulled a half-eaten
packet of orange flavored Shot Bloks and handed them to me. "Have them," he said,
"I'll just throw them out otherwise." I mumbled some words of profuse gratitude, 
crammed the sugar pellets into my mouth, and almost immediately 
felt the sensation of energy flooding back into my muscles. The bonk situation
had been handled and the sun was starting to rise again. No matter how sleepy
I get on a ride, sunrise is an incontestable boon to my mental state. I felt
as restored as one can feel after 23 hours of riding, and ready to tackle the
final climb out of Sausalito up to the Golden Gate Bridge.

On the recommendation of a fellow randonneur who had ridden Fish Rock Road,
we decided to bring a spare tire in case one of ours fell victim to a sharp
rock or piece of gravel on the dirt portion of the ride. While our tires
held up on that segment, our ride through Sausalito was punctuated by the
loud bang of Brian's rear tire in a sidewall blowout. With less than an hour
to go, we performed an impressively quick tire change. Funny that the spare
tire came useful in the most benign of all places.

![Finish](/images/fish_rock_fleche/06_finish.jpg)

We completed the ride at Crepes on Cole with 15 minutes to spare, and were greeted
by a group of cheery volunteers and several other groups of flèche finishers.
A tall glass of orange juice and a gigantic savory crepe later, and I was
definitely ready for bed. We stuck around for a few minutes chatting with
several other teams, but truth be told, I was too exhausted to spend much
energy socializing. I got back on my bike, rode home, took a long hot shower,
collapsed into bed, and drifted off into dreams of next year's flèche.
