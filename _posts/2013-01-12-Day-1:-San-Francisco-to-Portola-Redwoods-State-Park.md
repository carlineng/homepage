Our route for day 1 underwent many different iterations, but for a variety of reasons,
we settled on getting a late start and riding Caltrain to Redwood City. This would
allow us to relax in the morning and get the tour started off right. We agreed to meet
at Dynamo Donuts at 8:30, have a quick breakfast of donuts and coffee, then board the 10:15
southbound train.

Noah and I were both skeptical that donuts would provide the necessary sustenance for
a hard day's ride, so before rolling out the door we each downed a quick bowl of
oatmeal, complete with plenty of brown sugar, oatmeal, and peanut butter. We arrived
at Dynamo just after 8:30 and ordered second breakfast -- a caramel apple donut and large
french pressed coffee for me.

We briefly debated getting a more filling breakfast from HRD Cafe in SOMA, but decided
to skip it, and instead headed straight for the Caltrain station. A block away from
the station by the stoplight at 4th and Townsend, we experienced our first mechanical.
Brian pulled up to the red light at the intersection and started to trackstand.
Unaccustomed to trackstanding with a heavy front-load, his front wheel began to flop
and he torqued the handlebars in an attempt to recover. Though he saved himself from
falling over, the quill stem had not been tightened enough and twisted about 45
degrees to the side, skewing the handlebars as well. Luckily an easy fix, and good
for a few laughs.

With plenty of time to spare before the southbound train departed, Brian shot photos
of each of us individually with our touring setups. The area around 4th and King is
home to a fairly large population of eccentrics who made their presence known during
our impromptu photo shoot. This particular character waved a variety of shampoos
and deoderants at us while invading our pictures.

We boarded our bikes on Caltrain and sat in the bike car for our uneventful ride down
the Peninsula. We disembarked at Redwood City around 11 AM, and at last our cycling
mileage began. Our first destination was Robert's Market in Woodside, where we planned
to pick up lunch before climbing Old La Honda towards our goal of Portal Redwoods
State Park. Before even a mile of pavement had passed under our tires, I felt my rear
wheel begin to freeze up and I could not pedal forward. I hopped off the bike to
examine to drivetrain and discovered that the cassette lockring had fallen off and the
cassette cogs were rattling off my rear hub -- a pretty alarming mechanical failure.
We hand tightened the lockring as a temporary fix and looked up the nearest bike shop
where the appropriate tools would be available to actually fix the issue. I followed
the rest of the crew, pedaling gingerly, about a mile and a half down El Camino Real to
Chain Reaction Cycles where they tightened down the lockring. An older man who looked
like the manager asked us about our trip and gave us some good pointers for routes
to take in and around Portola. We thanked the shop and continued on to Robert's.

Robert's Market in Woodside is a hub of activity for cyclists because of its proximity
to some of the premier riding in the Peninsula. King's Mountain and Old La Honda are
both a stone's throw away. They also make killer sandwiches. With my mechanical failure,
we arrived at Robert's around noon, just in time for lunch. We all felt rather silly
breaking for a big lunch since we had barely ridden at all (about 7 miles so far), but
obviously not silly enough to skip the stop. After polishing off my rosemary garlic
chicken breast sandwich and filling up my handlebar bag with snacks, we set off for Old
La Honda, our first real climb of the day.

Old La Honda is a quintessential Bay Area climb, stretching over three miles and gaining almost
1,300 feet of elevation. Every weekend, roadies flock to Portola Valley and hammer up
the climb to try and beat the benchmark time of 20 minutes. Large and beautiful
redwoods line the plentiful switchbacks and offer shade to hundreds of cyclists every day. The
road crests at Skyline (CA route 35) and descends the west side of the ridge on a
narrow chipseal road exposed to the sky and a glorious view of the valley below.
West Old La Honda is easily one of my favorite descents.

Eventually, the road merges back with La Honda (CA route 84), and continues into the
town of La Honda, where we stopped to pick up dinner supplies for our first night of
camping -- ground beef, onions, bell peppers, refried beans, cheese, and corn
tortillas. We descended further down the ridge via Pescadero Road until we hit our
second big climb of the day, West Alpine road. The West Alpine terrain is similar to
that of Old La Honda, yet it feels far more remote and much quieter.

Worn out from two long, tough climbs with fully loaded bikes, we were all relieved to 
reach the top. A sign by the entrance to Portola State Park Road informed us that the
campgrounds were officially closed, raising concerns about the water and firewood
situation. Eager to get to the campgrounds before sundown, we took the steep descend
down into Portola State Park and rolled up to the campgrounds to find the ranger
station closed and the firewood shed locked. Luckily the taps were running, so
we had plenty of water. The entire campground and visitor center area was completely deserted. Apparently no
one else was crazy (or stupid) enough to spend the night outdoors in sub-freezing
temperatures. We scouted out several campgrounds and laid out our bikes and tents at
a site we deemed satisfactory.

![Nighttime cooking](/images/swoopheretour2013/day1/12_night_cooking.jpg)

There were three campstoves between the six of us, so dinner was a collaborative
effort that turned out wonderfully. After eating and packing all our food and dirty
dishes into our site's bear locker, we set our minds to keeping ourselves warm.
Temperatures were already dropping below freezing. Without access to any 
sort of firewood, building a real fire proved difficult. Ian had picked up a 
firestarter brick in La Honda, and we wandered the grounds searching 
for dead and dried wood. Foraging is not allowed at most campgrounds, this one
included, but we felt it was excusable given the circumstances. Portola State Park
is covered by a large canopy of enormous redwoods which prevents sunlight from
reaching the forest floor and drying out the various scattered twigs and branches.
Anything and everything we picked off the ground was too damp and would not take flame.
Despite our best efforts, our pathetic fire lasted less than an hour and gave off
hardly any warmth.

![Around fire](/images/swoopheretour2013/day1/14_us_around_fire.jpg)

Our whiskey supplies petered out fairly early, so deprived of warmth from either
fire or alcohol, we turned in for the night. I shared my two person tent with Ian,
inside of which I had the privilege to listen to his dramatic reading of the first chapter of The Magic Mountain 
by Thomas Mann. The other tents were occupied by Luke and Irving, and Brian and
Noah. We passed the remainder of the evening chatting, until finally falling
asleep around 10 PM.

All in all, a great start to the tour -- just under 30 miles of riding on the day, and
3,700 feet of climbing.
