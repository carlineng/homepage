The last day of the tour was upon us, and far too soon for my liking; although after nearly
a week without the comforts of civilization, we most certainly welcomed hot showers and
hot food. Before leaving for our final destination of Hanford, we stopped at the adjacent
McDonalds for some greasy, delicious breakfast of watery coffee, hashbrowns, and sausage
McGriddle sandwiches to fuel our last mileage.

The riding from Coalinga to Hanford is, believe it or not, mind numbingly boring. For the
first hour, we
rolled along the shoulder of Hwy 198, a relatively heavily trafficked and fast moving
highway. Scenery, excepting the foggy haze of the Central Valley, was non-existant, and
fast moving trucks swept by us every twenty minutes. Thankfully, after twenty miles,
our route took us off the main highway onto a calmer sidestreet.

Our train back to the Bay Area was scheduled to leave at 2:30 PM. We hoped to make
it to Hanford before 1:00 to leave plenty of time for lunch, so we rode in a relatively
tight paceline, traveling much faster than we had on previous days. Unfortunately, Brian,
in a moment of distraction, touched wheels with the rider in front of him and went down.
His fully packed panniers cushioned much of the impact, and he walked away with some
minor road rash and torn knickers.

We stopped for a bit to rest and let Brian collect himself. While the others were
inspecting the bike and rider for potential damage, I noticed that the road ran
straight through a pomegranate orchard and the roadside was littered with rotting
pomegranates. Never one to let a natural resource go to waste, I picked up one
of the softball-sized fruits and hurled it as far as I could. It flew through the
air in a nice arc and smacked back down onto the pavement in a satisfying explosion
of crimson juice and white pith. The rest of the crew caught on to what great fun
could be had and joined in hurling rotten pomegranates across the road.
We entertained ourselves this way for several minutes while getting the stink-eye
from random traffic passing by.

The rest of the ride to Hanford was more of the same, and completely uneventful.
We arrived just after noon, giving us plenty of time to get lunch and hang out.
We settled on a Mexican restaurant close to the Amtrak station. After lunch, we still
had two hours to burn. A Yelp search of Hanford quickly revealed our obvious next
destination: The Superior Dairy Products Company, an old school diner and ice cream
parlor.

We ordered an enormous four-scoop sundae with walnuts, whipped cream, and hot fudge.
It cost $7.00, which in most San Francisco ice cream shops only buys you a fraction
of the dairy product you see here. The ice cream was delicious, and the
perfect way to finish our tour -- the proverbial cherry on top.

The five-hour Amtrak ride was pleasant enough, especially with beers in hand and the
thought of home on our minds. At Emeryville we disembarked, took BART home to San
Francisco, and finally rolled home. And so concluded our tour of Northern California,
Pinnacles National Park, and the Central Valley -- six of the best days I've ever
spent on the bike. I can hardly wait for my next bike tour, whenever that may be.
