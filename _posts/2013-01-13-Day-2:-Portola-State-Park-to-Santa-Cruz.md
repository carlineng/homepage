Day 2 started very much like day 1 ended. Cold. A large canopy covers the Portola campgrounds
and sunlight struggles to make its way through the trees, so even though we woke
up fairly late, it was still dark and chilly. 
On most bike camping trips, I bring a 3/4 length sleeping pad which is sufficient for most Bay Area
camping locations and packs down very nicely. Unfortunately, it leaves my
feet touching the ground. For very cold nights, this is extremely uncomfortable.
The majority of the night, I was tossing and turning from the cold, and when I woke up,
I found my toes were completely numb.

Rather than double back on our route into the campground, we decided to ride Old Haul
Road on the way out, a five mile dirt path which Brian was particularly excited about.
Within the first 100 yards of dirt, we hit an extremely steep pitch, rising about
35 feet over a 30% grade. With loaded bikes and slick tires, no one was able to
make it up without dismounting. The rest of the trail rolled gently through the forest
over a mixture of hard packed dirt, mud, and sand. Both Luke and Brian stopped
several times to clear all the mud built up inside their fenders. The trail ends
at Pescadero Creek Rd, which we took to our lunch stop in the town of Pescadero.

The Pescadero Country Store at the intersection of Stage Rd is home to a fantastic deli,
a big barrel of enormous pickles, and loaves of fresh garlic artichoke bread. Originally,
Noah had planned to ride from Pescadero back to Palo Alto and take Caltrain back to San
Francisco, but during our lunch break he decided to stick with us just a little longer.
He called up his sister Alli, a Santa Cruz resident, to see if we could camp in her backyard
instead of New Brighton State Beach where it was bound to be much colder. To our delight,
she offered us a space inside her landlord's renovated barn. Although it was only the
second day of the tour, we welcomed the chance for some shelter after the freezing cold
of the first night.

As we ate our sandwiches, another cyclist on a lunch break stopped to ask us about
our tour. He recommended we ride the Pacific Coast Highway the whole way
south to Santa Cruz instead of the Cloverdale bypass we had originally intended,
claiming it was more scenic and had better tailwinds. In addition, he encouraged us to check out
Pigeon Point Lighthouse and its historic [Fresnel lens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_lens) with 1,011 prisms.
We followed his advice and spent the better part of an hour admiring the lighthouse and the
beautiful coastal views from Pigeon Point.

We had our first flat tire of the trip about 10 miles away from Santa Cruz, just past
the town of Davenport. Ian's Grand Bois Cypres tires picked up a staple which punctured
his inner tube. Fixing flats on a loaded bike is usually a giant pain in the ass, but
Ian had packed lightly enough that he didn't need to take off his bags or panniers to
flip the bike and fix it.

We rolled into downtown Santa Cruz ahead of schedule. Alli wouldn't be back to
meet us until 5, so we had an hour and a half to kill. We browsed the selection at the
Sock Shop, wandered inside Bookshop Santa Cruz, and enjoyed lattes and praline coffee
ice cream at the kiosk outside. Santa Cruz's reputation as a city embracing weirdness
certainly met my expectations. On the ride out to Alli's house, we spotted no less
than three folk/bluegrass bands in the span of five blocks, all jamming out to
roughly the same bluegrass lick. One of the bass players wore a baseball cap
with the word "FUCKHEAD" in big bold letters.

Alli, her dog Nitsy, her landlord Christopher, and his friend Don all came out to greet us as we rolled
up to the driveway. The barn where we would be staying had recently been converted into
an amateur brewery. Immediately after we stowed our bikes and unloaded our luggage, we
were given the brewery tour and an impromptu tasting -- two different hefeweizens,
a pale ale and a saison. After a fifty mile ride, two beers is more than enough to put
me solidly in "drunk" territory. Both Christopher and Don shared their feelings about
recent trends in craft beers, the majority of which they feel are way overhopped, which
overpowers the subtle flavors of different malts and yeasts.

After dinner at a local burger joint nearby, we set up our sleeping bags in the
loft of the barn and called it a night. The next day would be our longest day of riding,
and we were hoping for an early start.
