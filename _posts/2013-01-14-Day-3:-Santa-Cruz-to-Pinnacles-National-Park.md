Day 3 of the tour was scheduled to be our longest day of riding at just under 80
miles, so everyone agreed to an early start. We all woke around 5:15 AM and
slowly dressed and gathered our supplies. With a roof over our heads to shelter
us from the bitter cold outdoors, we all felt relatively well rested, and without
any tents to take down, we made it out the door by 6 and headed off for our
breakfast destination, Gayle's Bakery in Capitola. Noah had only planned on hanging
with us for the weekend, so he planned on staying in Santa Cruz for the morning
and hitching a ride over the mountains back to work. We said good-bye to him and
headed towards breakfast.

Some friends of ours took a trip to Hawaii during the same time frame as our
tour, and through Instagram we could keep track of their travels. As a joke,
we mimicked several of their photos and posted them. On the ride over to Gayle's,
we spotted the perfect opportunity for such a shot.

Hawaii looks warm and inviting. Capitola looks downright chilly. In this shot,
I'm wearing a base layer, a long sleeve wool jersey, a wool sweater, and my
hi-vis windbreaker over top.

We reached Gayle's just after sunrise. Inside, there is a huge counter full of pastries, cookies, and
sundry sweets. Off to the left side of the counter, they have several plates
full of savory breakfast foods -- croissant sandwiches, breakfast burritos,
home fried potatoes, and more. We each ordered up a large breakfast, (2
breakfast burritos and a large coffee for me), as well as snacks for the ride
ahead. We rolled out towards Watsonville just as the morning rush started to hit
the bakery.

Despite the dazzling sunlight, the cold morning air still cut through our layers.
Most of the roads through Watsonville run adjacent to farmland and orchards. In the 25 mile
stretch in between Watsonville and Hollister, we passed by countless rows of apples,
pomegranates, and artichokes, with not much else in between aside from what we guessed was
either a mine or granite quarry with a huge conveyer belt spanning the valley. For the most part, the roads
were well maintained with a decent shoulder to ride in. While we shared the road with lots
of high speed truck traffic, most of the drivers gave us plenty of room as they passed,
and some even offered an encouraging nod or wave.

We hit the Hollister Safeway around noon for lunch. Safeway is a popular location for
randonneuring control points, as they are usually open 24 hours. As we rolled up to the
automatic sliding doors, I couldn't help but feel like we were in the middle bof a brevet.
It felt late to me; much later than the 12 o'clock reading off my phone, probably because
we had been riding since before dawn. We spent quite awhile at Safeway eating lunch,
refilling liquids and snacks, and shopping for the next round of meals. We planned on taking
a rest day in Pinnacles just to explore the park, so we needed to bring enough food to last
for five meals: that night's dinner, all three meals the following day, and breakfast on
our day of departure. Completely loaded down with food, Brian's bike probably weighed in the
range of 80 pounds.

The ride from Hollister to Pinnacles was more of the same, except on a steady grade upwards.
We gained about 1000 feet over the next 35 miles on Hwy 25, through Paicines. Cattle
pastures on both sides of the road foreshadowed future bovine encounters. Just before
reaching Pinnacles, the road pitches steeply over a mile and a half climb. Carrying
the majority of the food and supplies, Brian and Irving took the climb slowly while
Ian, Luke and I went on ahead. The climb crests at a fire station, where we took a
break and waited for our friends to catch up. After 75 miles in the saddle, we all
welcomed the opportunity for a stretch. Ian wasted no time in demonstrating his yoga
proficiency. Below, he strikes a flawless Warrior Pose.

After about fifteen minutes of waiting, Luke began to worry that something had happened
on the climb and suggested we descend back down to check -- an idea that Ian and I
both quickly shot down, figuring there wasn't much we would be able to do for them,
and any descending would just be wasted energy. A couple of minutes later, they
reached the top, and it turns out that they had indeed had a flat tire.
The rest of the route into the National Park is a beautiful, gently swooping descent,
with awe inspiring views of the mountains ahead.

We made it to the park entrance just before sunset and were greeted by the camp
host, India, and her dog -- our second night in a row with a dog at our campsite!

![India and her dog](/images/swoopheretour2013/day3/07_camp_host_dog.jpg)

India sold us three bundles of firewood and warned us that the previous night
had dropped to 16 degrees Fahrenheit. Not a good sign for us, but at least we
would have a fire going. Pinnacles has well over a hundred campgrounds, but
many of them are sheltered from the morning sun by the mountain range to the east.
With some guidance from India, we chose a campground that would hopefully see early
sunlight, and rushed to set up our tents and sleeping supplies before the last
of the daylight faded. We also wasted no time getting a roaring fire started.
In preparation for the sub-freezing temperatures, I layered on nearly everything I
owned: two wool t-shirts, a waffle knit long-sleeve tee, a heavyweight short-sleeve
wool jersey, a mid-weight long-sleeve wool jersey, a green 1/4 zip wool sweater,
my Columbia omni-heat jacket, a pair of long-johns, a pair of leg warmers, my
neck warmer, and my possum wool gloves and hat.

![Fire at least](/images/swoopheretour2013/day3/08_fire_at_last.jpg)

Dinner consisted of mashed potatoes, pita bread, mixed greens, a Safeway
rotisserie chicken, and two bottles of Bulleit bourbon. The bottles mimicked
mercury thermometers -- the level of their contents dropped as rapidly as the air
temperature. Before too long, frost started to form on all of our bikes and
equipment, and the water inside our bottles began to freeze. Brian, Ian, Luke,
and Irving moved their tents closer to the campfire, and we decided to ration
our firewood and leave some for the morning.

![Frozen bottle](/images/swoopheretour2013/day3/10_bottle_freezing.jpg)

We spent the rest of the night huddled around the fire, taking pulls of bourbon
and staring at the stars. Around 11 PM, I had had enough and turned in for the
night. Although it was significantly warmer in my tent than outside, I was still
nervous for the coming hours where the temperature would drop even further.
