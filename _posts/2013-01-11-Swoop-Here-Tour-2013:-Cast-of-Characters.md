The heroes of the story are a motley bunch, all clad in wool and leather, riding atop
steel frames that would make the surliest retrogrouch proud. There is, however, a
very conspicious lack of facial hair amongst this group of would-be 
[Sheldon Browns](http://sheldonbrown.com/eagle.html).
No great surprise given the genetic make up of the group -- over 50% Asian. On the
BART trip back to the city, Luke quipped to a stranger "for a bunch of geeky looking dudes, we
just went through some pretty manly shit." I couldn't agree more. Without further ado,
here is the cast of adventurers.

## Carlin

![Carlin](/images/swoopheretour2013/mug_shots/carlin.jpg)
This is me! I'm riding a Surly Cross Check. I bought the bike from Box Dog Bikes in
the summer of 2011. The bike has been through many different iterations, and the frame
has certainly lived up to its name as an all-rounder. I've ridden it as a
road bike, a cyclocross racer, a randonneur, and most recently on this trip, a loaded
tourer. My favorite piece on this bike is definitely the handlebar bag, made by Loyal Designs
in Richmond, CA. The bag gives me a surprising amount of extra carrying capacity and
keeps commonly accessed items such as snacks or extra layers of clothing within easy
reach. The rear rack (Tubus Luna) is only rated for 40 pounds of weight. Luckily, with
such a big group, heavier items like camp stoves needn't be carried by all members, so
I could get away with carrying a little less than if I were solo or with just one other.

## Brian

Fully decked out with Ortlieb and Acorn luggage, Brian carried the heaviest load of the 
group on his early 90's Koga-Miyata touring bike. This bike was recently the victim of an
unfortunate traffic collision, but Brian did an excellent job of sourcing replacement
parts and completing all the repairs in time for the trip.

## Irving

Irving on his trusty Specialized Expedition. This bike/rider combo has seen more tours
than any other pair in the group, including a two week tour from Eugene, OR to San
Francisco. With both front and rear carrying capacity to match Brian, Irving carried 
the second heaviest load of the trip.

## Ian

Ian is a proud owner of the venerable Box Dog Pelican, a frame designed by the minds
at Box Dog Bikes, our preferred LBS and supplier of randonneuring accoutrements (read: 
steel and leathery bits). The bike has a classic build, taking most of its cues from
the French constructeur aesthetic, with a hint of Rivendell. Ian avoided packing any
unnecessary equipment and had by far the lightest and most compact load. Unfortunately,
the frame still suffered from minor shimmy throughout the trip.

## Luke

The most colorful beast of the bunch, Luke, sports a pink Bruce Gordon Hikari draped
with flashy panniers and bags, all made by Swift Industries. On his head
sits a cap from Golden Saddle Cyclery, an undeniably hip bike shop located in LA. The
shop and its hordes of hypebeast acolytes would later become the subject of much 
mockery throughout the tour.

## Noah

Originally, Noah had planned to build and ride a Rivendell Bleriot for this trip, but
before we had a chance to complete the build, the frame was damaged in the same auto
collision that also took out Brian's bike. Without the Bleriot, Noah reverted back to
his old Salsa Casseroll, but switched from drop handlebars to the swept back porteur
bars you see here. These handlebars give him a more upright position, which helps
alleviate neck and back pain associated with long hours in the saddle. The beautiful
auburn handlebar bag was made by our friend Ely, right here in San Francisco.

## So there you have it...
That's our crew. The Best Dudes, The So Good Gang, The Swoop Here Cyclists, The Geeky
Lookin' Guys On Bikes. Each of the posts that follows will be a recount of our days
on the tour. Adventure, drama, suspense -- all these things await you, dear reader!
