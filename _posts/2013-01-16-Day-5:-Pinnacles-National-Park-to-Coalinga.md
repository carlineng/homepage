A 5:30 AM wake-up is never easy, especially so in sub-freezing temperatures, but we
wanted to get on the road relatively early, so I reluctantly left the warmth of my
tent and sleeping bag to help pack up camp. This morning was even colder than the
last, and considerably more frost had gathered on our equipment.

![Frosted bag](/images/swoopheretour2013/day5/00_frosted_bag.jpg)

Everyone alternated between warming their hands at the campfire and packing the remainder
of the campsite onto our bikes. By 7 AM we had packed everything and set off for the road,
totally bundled up, and hands and toes completely numb from the cold. The pipes had been 
shut off overnight, so we were unable to refill our water, and numerous signs warned 
us of the lack of any services between
Pinnacles and our destination, Coalinga, 75 miles out. I had one full bottle and another
about a quarter full. Definitely less than ideal, but it would have to last.

![Morning starte](/images/swoopheretour2013/day5/01_morning_start.jpg)

It warmed up rapidly as the sun rose over the horizon, and as the feeling returned
to our extremities, we began to shed layers. Rather than ride along Highway 25 to Coalinga
Road, we opted instead for Old Hernandez Road, a wide fire road with almost 
no traffic, frequented only by the cattle ranchers of the region. 
The road runs through a valley in the Diablo mountain range,
with pastures running all along the north side. Cattle roam the fields, grazing and expelling
up and down the path, leaving a staggering number of cow patties as evidence.

![No hunting](/images/swoopheretour2013/day5/02_no_hunting_sign.jpg)

Several miles down the road, we came across signs warning us of road closures 5.5 miles ahead.
With typical cavalier adventure cyclist attitudes, we figured the sign meant "closed to cars",
and decided to push on ahead. Not long after, yet more signs informed us that we were entering
private property and warned us against trespassing, with particularly strong emphasis on "NO HUNTING".
After some debate, we agreed to continue. About a quarter mile further, we stopped to chat with
a lady walking her two dogs on the path. She warned us that the road ahead was likely washed out,
but if we were willing to attempt a stream crossing, we were welcome to ride on the trail.
Sure enough after a mile of riding, the road ended abruptly at the edge of a tiny, murky stream about
10 yards wide. We dubbed it "Cow Shit Creek", and prepared our bikes to ford the river -- shoes and
socks off, pants rolled up, and bags off the bike.

My feet felt numb the instant they hit the frigid waters, yet somehow the tiny rocks on the
streambed still jabbed rather painfully at my soles. We each took two trips back and forth
across the river -- one for our luggage, and another for our bikes -- and spent the next
few minutes drying off and wiping the mud and cow poop off our feet. For a second we considered
pumping the stream water through Brian's filter and refilling our bottles, but decided to
hold off until further upstream where hopefully it wouldn't be quite so gross.

![Cattle on the road](/images/swoopheretour2013/day5/04_cattle_on_the_road.png)

The rest of Old Hernandez was more hard packed dirt with cattle idly roaming the pastures
along the roadside. A small group of had cows found their way onto the road, and we chased
them along for the better part of an hour.

![Lunch break](/images/swoopheretour2013/day5/05_lunch_break.jpg)

At the intersection of Old Hernandez and Coalinga Road, we stopped to break for lunch, which
was mostly just an assortment of energy bars and candy we picked up at the general store
in Pinnacles. Continuing south on Coalinga Road, we rolled past a lonely house by the 
roadside where an old man sat on a porch
rocking chair looking out on the road. We stopped and asked him if we could refill our
water bottles, since the temperature was climbing rapidly and we still had plenty of
miles and elevation gain ahead of us. He offered to top us off with water from his well,
and we continued to chat with him and his wife, two old retired ranchers, for several 
minutes before moving on. Though we were grateful for the water, it tasted soapy and
had an odd mouthfeel, probably due to the mineral content of the well. We ended up
dumping the water and pumping stream water through our filter when
we were satisfied that the stream looked sufficiently clear.

The old rancher had warned us of steep grades ahead, and sure enough, we hit a steady climb
leading to the top of Laguna Mountain. The temperature had risen from below freezing in the
morning to blistering hot in the afternoon, and halfway up the climb, I had stripped
down to only bibshorts and baselayer -- crazy, considering that when we set out in
the morning I was wearing nearly everything I owned. After a second shallower, but longer
climb, the rest of the ride was a steady, 20 mile descent down into the Central Valley.

![Coalinga oil wells](/images/swoopheretour2013/day5/06_coalinga_oil_wells.jpg)

We hammered down the entire descent and landed at the bottom in the midst of a creepy, barren
field littered with oil wells, mostly dormant, but a select few still creaking and groaning
as they pumped oil to the surface. With most of our mileage and climbing done for the day,
everyone was feeling the fatigue of riding 70 miles while baking in the sun, so we slow-rolled
towards our motel.

![Industrial cattle ranch](/images/swoopheretour2013/day5/07_industrial_cattle_ranch.jpg)

The oil fields soon gave way to a vast complex of ugly and rancid cattle feedlots, with
the overpowering stench of manure permeating the air. The cows
in the pastures we passed along Old Hernandez Road lived an idyllic life, running free
and grazing the lands. These cattle most certainly did not. They were packed tightly in
muddy quarters, and as we rolled by, they stamped their feet and snorted at us
distressfully.

We stopped at the top of the last short climb for a unique photo opportunity, courtesy
of Luke's Instagram skills. A short descent later, and we were at our motel
in the middle of the truck stop complex in Coalinga, right next to Harris Ranch.

![Motel 6](/images/swoopheretour2013/day5/08_motel_6.jpg)

The motel room felt cramped with five of us jammed in, but we were all extraordinarily
happy to have our first shower in several days. After some preliminary unpacking and
settling in, we walked over to our dinner stop, [Harris Ranch](http://www.yelp.com/biz/harris-ranch-inn-and-restaurant-coalinga),
a steakhouse notorious for enormous portions of bone-in prime rib.
It was a somewhat odd choice, especially given our disgust at the feedlot we had just
ridden past, but after so many hours on the bike, our bodies craved a high-calorie, high-protein
meal. Irving, Brian, and I all ordered the infamous prime rib cut, which, according to the menu
weighed in at 20 ounces. When the steaks arrived, they were at *least* three pounds of meat
apiece. Even with our immense appetites, not a single one of us was able to finish more than half
of a portion.

Completely stuffed, and rather woozy from dinnertime drinks, we walked back to the motel 
and spent the rest of the evening watching bad cable television before finally passing out.
