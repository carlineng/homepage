This is my first blog post.

I registered the domain carlineng.com after my coworker George fell victim to a cruel prank, which as far as I know, he's still unaware even happened.
While very vocally mulling over whether or not to purchase his eponymous domain, a couple of other coworkers acted before he had the chance. The domain name now lies in wait, ready to play its part in some grander scheme to antagonize him.
Accordingly wary of prank-happy colleagues, I decided to claim ownership over my own domain name.

For awhile, I let it sit dormant until Amazon announced [root domain website hosting for S3](http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/12/root-domain-website-hosting-for-amazon-s3.html). I followed the instructions in the blog post, and was led to [Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/), a static website generator which this site is built on.

I would like to improve my writing skills, so this site will mostly be a vehicle to that end. Likely topics include bikes, books, movies, or anything that deserves more than 140 characters' worth of attention.

'til next time,

Carlin
