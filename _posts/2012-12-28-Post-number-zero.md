This is my first blog post.

I registered the domain carlineng.com after a brief work conversation in which George mentioned that he had many times contemplated registering his eponymous domain, but had yet to pull the trigger. He said half-jokingly that he was sure the next time he checked the domain, it would be taken.
Unable to resist the temptation, Scott registered the domain that very instant and casually remarked "Just do it. It's not that expensive, and it's certainly worth your time." George, ignorant of the ruse, nodded in agreement and pointed his browser to godaddy, only to find the domain snapped up, a cursory WHOIS search turning up only the cryptic name "State Beach LLC". Accordingly wary of prank-happy coworkers and the other Carlin Eng's of the world, I picked up my own domain.

For awhile, I let it sit dormant until Amazon announced [root domain website hosting for S3](http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/12/root-domain-website-hosting-for-amazon-s3.html). I followed the instructions in the blog post, and was led to [Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/), a static website generator, which this site is built on.

I would like to improve my writing skills, so this site will mostly be a vehicle to that end. Likely topics include bikes, books, movies, or anything that deserves more than 140 characters' worth of attention.

'till next time,

Carlin
