Day 4 was our rest day -- a day we intended to use exploring Pinnacles, the nation's
newly minted National Park. I woke up around 7 o'clock and
timidly stepped outside of my tent, bracing myself for the cold. The mountains to our
east cast a long shadow over our campground, so even though it was light out, the
temperature was still probably in the high 30s. I had my sleeping arrangement
well worked out -- Noah lent me his sleeping pad, which I used to keep my feet off
the ground. Wearing all my clothing, with my sleeping bag cinched tight around my
neck, and a wool sweater covering my head and face, I didn't suffer too much during
the night.

As I stepped out of the tent, I saw Irving huddled around the remains of the fire,
with some, how shall I say... "native" firewood now in the fire pit. Apparently,
Luke, Irving, and Brian all spent the night in total misery. At 3 AM, Luke woke from
a nightmare in which he was literally dying from the cold. The dream wasn't too far
off from the truth, and he fed the last of the purchased firewood to the embers in
our fire pit. Similarly miserable, Brian and Irving crawled out of their tents to
absorb some warmth from the flames. As Irving tells it, they were a bit too aggressive
in feeding the flames and used all the firewood in one glorious 30 minute blaze.
When the flames started to die out, they became desperate and started foraging for
scraps of dried and dead wood.

Around 8, after a mostly sleepless night Irving returned to his tent to try and
catch some shut-eye. Around the same time, Ian emerged from the tent and we
spent some time wandering the campgrounds while the rest of the party slept. Nearly
everything had frozen overnight, and a thin layer of frost now covered all our bikes.
We spotted plenty of wildlife running around the mostly deserted
campgrounds -- rabbits, quail, sparrows and more. Only three other
campsites were occupied by humans, and it appeared that they had all chosen (wisely) to
sleep in their cars.

By 10:30, the sun had finally risen over the horizon and cast its warm rays on our
site. With the sun on their tents, the rest of the crew slowly started moving and
we began preparing our brunch of bacon, eggs, and cheese. After finishing the meal
and cleaning up, we set off on our bikes for Bear Gulch just up the road. Although
we had initially planned a longer hike for our day off, everyone felt worn out
and we all agreed that a short adventure, followed by relaxing at the campground,
would be much better. We left our helmets behind and set off on the country road,
feeling very much like subjects of a Rivendell or Rapha catalog.

The way up to Bear Gulch is a short climb with a few very wide turns. Always on
the lookout for photo opportunities, Brian insisted we stop at one of the turns and
hold on impromptu photo shoot. One by one, we would all climb just past the turn, then
descend full speed and lean into the turn as hard as we could I'm not a fan of 
staged "badass" photos, and only half-heartedly obliged his request. Ian manned the
camera for Brian's turn, which ended up by far the best of the bunch.

We reached Bear Gulch and spent the next hour wandering through the caves 
about a half mile from the trailhead. We could hear the sound of rushing water
all throughout the caves, and as we climbed through the rocks, we caught an occasional
glimpse of the river that flowed through.

Above us, we could see water dripping
off the cliff face and forming giant icicle patches in the shade. One particularly
interesting ice formation had trapped and completely frozen half of large fern.

After circling back to the trailhead, we rolled back to the campsite and began prepping
for the following day's ride. The next day was scheduled for 75 miles and quite a bit
of climbing, so an early start was in order. We agreed on a 6:30 rollout, which meant
waking up at 5:30. As such, we packed and cleaned up as much of the campsite as possible
and started on dinner -- Kraft Mac and Cheese with hot dogs, bacon, bell peppers,
and zucchini. Since we had way underestimated our firewood needs on the previous night,
we decided to err on the other side tonight and spent $55 on firewood, for five large bundles.
We wanted to keep at least a small fire going through the entire night, so in the morning
as we prepared to leave, we would be able to stay somewhat warm.

The sun began to set around 5:30 and painted the sky with a gorgeous palette of deep reds,
purples, yellows, and blues. With the sun down, and most everyone in our group
still hungover from the night before, we huddled around the fire and spent the evening
chatting. At one point, our conversation was interrupted by a rustling on the picnic
table. A band of four raccoons hopped on the table, a mere five or so feet
behind us, and tried to steal a package of hot dogs that we had carelessly left out.
We scared them off and spent the next few minutes making sure everything in our campground
was properly secured. Brian went so far as to wrap our bear locker in several layers of
bright orange duct tape.

Not long after, I decided to call it a night and retire to my tent. My throat was extremely
scratchy and I had several sores in my mouth, I suspect from spending so much time
near the campfire and breathing the smoke-filled air. Even though it was chilly in my tent,
it was a relief to breath the clean, fresh air. I wrapped myself in my sleeping bag like
an overstuffed Chipotle burrito and drifted off to sleep.
