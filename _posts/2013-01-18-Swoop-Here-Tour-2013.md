I'd never done a bicycle tour before. This would be my first. Irving and Brian both
had significant touring experience and all the requisite camping gear, so when the
initial idea of bike touring through Joshua Tree National Park came up, I figured
I could rely on their expertise and equipment to make up for my own lack of either.
Unfortunately, travel logistics became too complicated, and to simplify matters, we
decided instead to travel to Pinnacles National Monument in mid-January.
Two others joined us for the full tour: our randonneuring friend Ian, and Irving's 
buddy from the Serotta Classifieds forums, Luke.
Noah, unsure of his biking ability, figured he would join for the beginning of the tour 
and turn back home after the first night of camping.

On Friday, January 11, dead tired from a tough week at work and scrambling to finish
my last minute packing and bike maintenance, I went to bed anxious and excited for
the coming days. The six days that followed were jampacked with epic adventure.
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the Swoop Here Tour 2013!

Stay tuned -- the following posts will recount the zany adventures undertaken by
six bike nerds in the cold winter wilderness of California!
